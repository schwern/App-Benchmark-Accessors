NAME
    App::Benchmark::Accessors - Benchmark accessor generators

VERSION
    version 1.110100

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution runs benchmarks on various accessor generators. The
    following generators are being benchmarked:

    Moose
        mutable and immutable

    Mouse
        mutable and immutable

    Class::Accessor
    Class::Accessor::Fast
    Class::Accessor::Fast::XS
    Class::XSAccessor::Compat
    Class::Accessor::Complex
    Class::Accessor::Constructor
    Class::Accessor::Classy
    Class::Accessor::Lite
    Mojo::Base
    Class::MethodMaker
    Object::Tiny
    Spiffy
    Class::Spiffy
    "accessors"
    Class::XSAccessor
    Class::XSAccessor::Array
    Object::Tiny
    Rose
    Rubyish::Attribute

    The benchmarks are being run as part of the test suite; see
    App::Benchmark. This way you can look at this distribution's CPAN
    testers page to see the benchmark results on many different platforms
    and for many different perl versions.

    The "t/construction.t" file benchmarks object creation, "t/get.t"
    benchmarks getter methods and "t/set.t" benchmarks setter methods.

    Not every benchmark is run on every module; for example, Object::Tiny
    doesn't create setter methods, and accessors doesn't generate
    constructors.

    Each benchmark test file takes an optional numeric parameter that is
    used as the number of iterations.

    It's probably a good idea not to read too much into these benchmarks;
    they could be seen as micro-optimization. However, if you have a complex
    object hierarchy and create lots of objects and run many many
    getters/setters on them, they could help to save some time. But be sure
    to use Devel::NYTProf first to see where your real bottlenecks are.
